When I started learning more about web development, setting up my computer to be able to try out all the new things was something I really struggled to get right. This guide is based on what my instructors walked us through when I attended a full stack immersive program.

This article assumes your computer:

- Is running Mac OS X 10.12 El Capitan or above
- Is virus and malware free
- Uses the latest, stable version of its operating system
- Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
- Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
- Can reliably connect to wireless networks

This laptop will not work:

## First things first

Save all files you may have open and close all other applications. (If you are at home and want to make a backup of your computer just in case, now would be the time).

Make sure that you have your computer username and password memorized or handy and that you are the admin (or root) user for the computer (more help with user types [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21994?locale=en_US)).

## Mac OS X Updates

Before we dive in to modifications, open the AppStore application and check if you have any updates -- unless you are sure you don't need them, just accept all updates. This may take some time to download and install, but it is important to be starting with the most up to date operating system and tools.

If you don't have it installed already, search for and install Xcode.

When you're done, if it's not already required, reboot your computer.

Checklist:

* Updated to the latest version of Mac OS X
* Installed/Updated Xcode from the AppStore
* Run all updates from the AppStore
* Closed all applications
* Restarted your computer


## The Terminal

Included in Mac OS X is the **Terminal**—an app that runs a Unix shell. A **Unix shell** is a command line user interface between you and your computer's operating system.

### Terminal Options

There are many different options to customize your terminal app, however, rather than messing with the Mac OS X app, I recommend using iTerm with zsh.

First, download and install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)

You can customize the look of iTerm from the preferences menu OR follow this guide to [install z shell and oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/thacherT1D/fishToZsh) for even more functionality.

## Install Homebrew

Now that your Terminal is setup, it's time to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), the de facto package manager for OS X. If you've never heard of a package manager, think of it as an app store for **free** command line programs.

To get started, run the following command in your shell. It'll download and run a script file that downloads and installs Homebrew onto your development environment.

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

If asked, be sure to agree when asked to install the **Xcode CommandLine Tools**. It may take about 10 minutes to download and install.


### Update Homebrew

If you've previously installed Homebrew, now's a good time to update it by running the following command.

```
brew update
```

If it's been a while since the last update, you'll see something like this.

**PROTIP:** Run this command periodically as Homebrew doesn't automatically update itself.

### Verify Homebrew

To verify Homebrew is installed correctly, run the following command.

```
brew doctor
```

## Install and Configure Chrome

Now it's time to install Google Chrome, a fast and free web browser that automatically updates itself with the latest web technologies.

[Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/), open the disk image file, and drag the app icon into your `/Applications` folder.

**PROPROTIP:** Allow Chrome to become your default browser.

Firefox Developer Edition is also a solid choice for developers, but I prefer Chrome.

Navigate to the `Chrome > Preferences` -- scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Show advanced settings...** link. Scroll down a bit more until you find the **Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browser traffic** and check the box.

**PROTIP:** You may want to consider installing an [ad blocking extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) to Chrome.

## Install and Configure Atom

Now it's time to install [Atom](https://atom.io/), a hackable text editor for the 21st century.

To get started, [download Atom](https://atom.io/download/mac), unzip the archive file, and drag the app icon into your `/Applications` folder. Double click to open atom.

Close any tabs by pressing `Command` + `W`. Then, navigate to the `Atom > Preferences` menu item by pressing the `Command` + `,` .

Under the **Settings** tab, in the **Editor Settings** section, change the following:

| Name                               | Value              |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Font Family                        | Menlo              |
| Font Size                          | 18                 |
| Show Indent Guide                  | Checked            |

Under the **Install** tab, with the **Package** button highlighted, install the following:

| Name                           | Type    |
|--------------------------------|---------|
| file-icons                     | Package |
| language-fish-shell            | Package |

Under the **Install** tab, with the **Themes** button highlighted, install the following:

| Name                           | Type         |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| tomorrow-night-eighties-syntax | Syntax Theme |

Under the **Packages** tab search for autosave -- under **Core Packages** click the **Settings** button, in the **Settings** section check Enabled.

When you're done, close the preferences tab by pressing `Command` + `W`.

### Install the Shell Commands

You'll find it insanely useful to open files and directories into Atom from the Terminal.

To get started, select the `Atom > Install Shell Commands` menu item.


### Discover the `EDITOR` environment variable

Environment variables like `EDITOR` can be set in a shell's startup file. While Fish's startup file is handy, add the following settings.

```
# Atom
set -x EDITOR 'atom -w'
```

Now, relaunch the Terminal and verify these settings with the following command.

```
echo $EDITOR
```

## Install and Configure Git

Using Homebrew, you can also install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the version control system of choice among choosy developers.

To get started, run the following command.

```
brew install git
```

Once it finishes, run the following command.

```
git --version
```

Let's configure Git to sign your commits with your name and email address.

**WARNING:** Before running the following commands, replace `YOUR FULL NAME` and `YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS` with the name and email from [your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/profile).

```
git config --global user.name 'YOUR FULL NAME'
git config --global user.email 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'
```

## Install Node

Using Homebrew, you can also install [Node](https://nodejs.org/), an open-source, cross-platform runtime system for developing applications in JavaScript. In other words, it runs JavaScript outside the browser.

To get started, run the following command.

```
brew install node
```

Once it finishes, run the following command.

```
node -v
```

### Congratulations!

You've successfully setup a web development environment on Mac OS X!
